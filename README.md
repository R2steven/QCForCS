# QC4CS
is an open source quantum circuit simulator following the book [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computing-for-computer-scientists/8AEA723BEE5CC9F5C03FDD4BA850C711).

The goal of this repository is to build my knowledge of QC, and to build a portfolio so that interested parties might follow along and see my work.
